High-frequency noise may be removed by applying a lowpass filter, and low-frequency noise may be removed by applying a highpass filter. However, improper selection of the cutoff frequencies of the filters could lead to distortions in the ECG signal, such as excessive smoothing or widening of the QRS complex, and distortion of PQ and ST segments.\n",
