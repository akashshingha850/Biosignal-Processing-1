        "A digital adaptive filter is basically constructed by two main components, including a digital FIR filter with adjustable coefficients and an adaptation algorithm which modifies the coefficients in order to optimize the filter. In MATLAB, the DSP System Toolbox includes the `dsp.LMSFilter` object that implements the classic LMS-filter among others.\n",
